### Exclusion and missed trials in risky decision-making dataset(s)

The RDM exclusion (descibed elsewhere) was applied across task type (gain-only and loss-only tasks), but participants who are exlcuded in phase 1 were not automatically excluded in phase 2 (and vice versa). Also, exclusion in one measurement (e.g. RDM) did not automatically exclude a participant's other measure (e.g. Qualtrics). Data from excluded participants was replaced with NA. For example, if a participant was excluded from phase 1 RDM only, then the rows for this participant's phase 1 RDM variables are NA, but their phase 2 RDM data (if applicable) and their Qualtrics responses were left as is. We beleive this method is most transparent and the analysis tools we use (e.g. "glmer") can handle NAs. Two of the three participants excluded in qualtrics because of their age responses (e.g. .32) were excluded entirely.

Based on risky decision-making exclusion criteria, we excluded 28 (26 based on rdm, 2 based on qualtrics age response) participants in phase 1 and 32 participants in phase 2 (31 based on rdm and 1 based on qualtrics age response from phase 1). Ten participants were excluded in both phases. The remaining dataset consists of risky choices from 518 participants in phase 1, 326 participants in phase 2, and 313 participants who are included in both phase 1 and phase 2. 

We then noted missed trials in the gain- and loss-only tasks of the remaining participants. Similar to the exclusion method above, we did not remove missed trials and instead they are noted by NAs for choice and outcome variables. 

In phase 1, 223 participants missed a total of 756 gain-only trials (mean = 1.338; median = 0; range = 0-21) and 151 participants missed a total of 245 loss-only trials (mean = .4537; median = 0; range = 0-7) resulting in a total 60,886 gain-only and 9,477 loss-only trials. 

In phase 2, 131 participants missed a total of 372 gain-only trials (mean = .862; median = 0; range = 0-15) and 65 participants missed a total of 88 loss-only trials (mean = .2117; median = 0; range = 0-3) resulting in a total of 38,421 gain-only and 6,432 loss-only trials. 

### Exclusion for Qualtrics responses

Three participants were excluded based on Qualtrics responses in phase 1 and 1 participant was excluded based on age response in phase 1. Two participants were excluded entirely aross datasets based on their age response (sub 30 in phase 1 and phase 2 and sub 373 in phase 1)
