Data set up is taken care of by RDMsteup.R script. 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}

# Looks for existing model file and if its found, then load it and we will now have our previous models in the environment
outputfile = file.path(config$path$Rdata, config$Rdata_files$models)

#if(exists(outputfile)){

#### Simple regressions for risky decision-making GAIN ONLY TASK
1) running on lab computer speeds it up a bit, still take a couple minutes.
2) Use glm to explore but very carefully (these take a second)
3) save the R data models (all model names start with "model" except those we don't want saved will start with "tmp")
 - each model has an if statement (using exist function) so that models we already have don't need to be run again

Note: adding "na.action = na.exclude" retains original row number which we need when pulling out residuals


### DOES TASK-RELATED STUFF ACCOUNT FOR RISK-TAKING (main model plus other variations we tried):
```{r}
# Simple, main model that we will take residuals from to do the remaining analyses (has task events only):
if(!exists('model_task')){
  model_task = glmer(rdmChoice~ 1 + rdmGainSC + rdmSafeSC + rdmGroundEV + (0 + rdmGainSC + rdmSafeSC|subID),data=rdmGainQualtrics,family="binomial",na.action=na.exclude, control=glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa",optCtrl = list(maxfun=1000000)) );
}
# AIC = 73436.9 - this is not the best AIC but we decided that it probably makes the most sense to keep this model simple (just letting task-related stuff do their things) and then see what else accounts for RDM behavior.

# Note: if we put a 1 in the random effects, it could wipe out subject level effects that we are interested in like affective measures (it wouldn't get rid of trial by trial stuff tho)


# Other models that we tried for our first-level and aren't going to use for residual analysis but want to save:

# Task events with phase and day:
if(!exists('model_taskPhaseDay')){
  model_taskPhaseDay=glmer(rdmChoice~ 1 + rdmGainSC + rdmSafeSC + rdmGroundEV + phaseRecode + dayOverallSC + (0 + rdmGainSC + rdmSafeSC|subID),data=rdmGainQualtrics,family="binomial", na.action=na.exclude, control=glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa",optCtrl = list(maxfun=1000000)) );
}
# AIC = 73419.3
# less risk taking in phase 2
# no effect of day 


# Task events with just phase
if(!exists('model_taskPhase')){
  model_taskPhase=glmer(rdmChoice~ 1 + rdmGainSC + rdmSafeSC + rdmGroundEV + phaseRecode + (0 + rdmGainSC + rdmSafeSC|subID),data=rdmGainQualtrics,family="binomial",na.action=na.exclude, control=glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa",optCtrl = list(maxfun=1000000)) );
}
# AIC = 73419.2
# less risk taking in phase 2

```

### Store residuals from our main model (model_task):
```{r}
rdmGainQualtrics$predmTask = predict(model_task, type="link"); 
```

### Models that involve residuals (the bulk of the analysis):

```{r}
# STAIS, STAIT, UCLAL, PSS:
if(!exists('model_pred_stais')){
  model_pred_stais = glmer(rdmChoice~  0 + stai_s_score_scaled + (1|subID), data=rdmGainQualtrics, family="binomial", control=glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa",optCtrl = list(maxfun=1000000)), offset=predmTask );
}
# singular
# no effect of stais
# AIC = 68601.5
# nObs = 98833

if(!exists('model_pred_stait')){
  model_pred_stait = glmer(rdmChoice~  0 + stai_t_score_scaled + (1|subID), data=rdmGainQualtrics, family="binomial", control=glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa",optCtrl = list(maxfun=1000000)), offset=predmTask  );
}
# no effect of stait
# AIC = 68601.5
# nObs = 98833
# singular

if(!exists('model_pred_uclal')){
  model_pred_uclal = glmer(rdmChoice~  0 + uclal_score_scaled + (1|subID), data=rdmGainQualtrics, family="binomial", control=glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa",optCtrl = list(maxfun=1000000)) ,offset=predmTask  );
}
# no effect of uclal
# AIC = 68601.5
# nObs = 98833
# singular


if(!exists('model_pred_pss')){
  model_pred_pss = glmer(rdmChoice~ 0 + pss_score_scaled + (1|subID), data=rdmGainQualtrics, family="binomial", control=glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa",optCtrl = list(maxfun=1000000)),offset=predmTask )
}
# no effect of pss
# AIC = 68601.6
# nObs = 98833
# singular


# COVID RISK: 
if(!exists('model_pred_covidRisk')){
  model_pred_covidRisk= glmer(rdmChoice ~  0 + covq_PAB_q1_personalRisk_scaledNoNA  + (1|subID), data=rdmGainQualtrics, family="binomial", na.action=na.exclude, control=glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa",optCtrl = list(maxfun=1000000)), offset=predmTask ); 
}

# AIC =  68719.1
# nObs = 98951
# effect of covid risk is negative and trending (beta = -0.02480(0.01496), p=0.0973)
# it was very significant in the main models above (not using residuals) - possible that the effect will change when in a model with temporal context effects
# singular

# covid risk mean: 5.26 phase 1 and 5.04 in phase 2 - TODO: follow up on this when we make individual-level affect dataframe

# TO DO:
# covid risk variable is capturing across and within subject stuff:
# 1) resrict data to one phase and if the pattern holds up, we atleast know that individual differences do matter
# 2) relate changes in risk taking to changes in perceived risk (using a variable that captures the difference in covid risk across phase 1)

# Affective measures... 
# - No observed effects (at this level) for STAIS, STAIT, UCLA-L or PSS
# - covid risk measure predicts less risk -taking
# model w/ covid risk (AIC = 73465.6) outperforms model with phase and day(AIC = 73516.2) and just phase (AIC =73516.4)


# TEMPORAL CONTEXT WITH COVID RISK:
if(!exists('model_pred_3timescales_covidRisk')){
  model_pred_3timescales_covidRisk = glmer(rdmChoice ~ 0 + rdmPOC1sc*rdmEarningSC + posShift +  rdmTrialSC + covq_PAB_q1_personalRisk_scaledNoNA + (1|subID), data=rdmGainQualtrics, family="binomial", offset=predmTask);
}

# AIC = 67085.1
# only covid risk not significant
# trial and earning opposite effects (both v sig)
# poc effect significant and has a negative interaction with earnings
# singular
# nObs = 97093

# TEMPORAL CONTEXT WITHOUT COVID RISK:
if(!exists('model_pred_3timescales')){
  model_pred_3timescales= glmer(rdmChoice ~ 0 + rdmPOC1sc*rdmEarningSC + posShift +  rdmTrialSC + (1|subID), data=rdmGainQualtrics, family="binomial", offset=predmTask);
}

# AIC =  67083.9
# everything significant, positive effect of past outcome, earnings (positive) and trial (negative) have opposing effects, shift positive, interaction between past outcome and earnings negative
# singular
# nObs = 97093

```


Affective measures: 
# in set up, create subject level dataframe for affective measures (vs what we already have at the trial-level)
# How do we find what is unique across our qualtrics responses?
# could do a component type of analysis for all of the qualtrics responses (Gillan et al 2016 does something like this)
# we could do this in a variety of ways (across all responses v. across all SES responses)
# Gillan (2016) used a package in R to do it 
# "Try not to get paralyzed by the world of ways to do this stuff - start simple"
# Use QualtricsCombined_subID_scored to start - lets just get the summary and standard deviations 
# then we move toward correllogram / run factor analysis / PCA stuff
