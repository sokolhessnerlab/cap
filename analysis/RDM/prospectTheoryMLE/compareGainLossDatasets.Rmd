We will be fitting a PT model to the CAP data. We have a gain-only choice set and a gain-loss choiceset. Participants were compensated from the gain-only adn the gain-loss choices were made after the gain-only choices. To determine whether we should fit BOTH of these choices at once, we will do some comparisons between the data.

1. Reaction Time
2. Missed trials


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library('config')
config = config::get()


# load csv file with both tasks
capdata = read.csv(file.path(config$path$combined, config$RDMcsvs$RDMbothTasks_qualtrics))

```


```{r}

# missed trials
sum(is.na(capdata$rdmChoice[capdata$rdmTask==1])); # 1.4% of trials missed (1495/107219) in gain-only task
sum(is.na(capdata$rdmChoice[capdata$rdmTask==2])); # 2.2% of trials missed (381/17353) in gain-loss task

# reaction time (even though we have a 2s forced viewing period)
summary(capdata$rdmRT[capdata$rdmTask==1]); # mean = .41, Median = .35
summary(capdata$rdmRT[capdata$rdmTask==1]); # mean = .41, Median = .33

```
