Data set up is taken care of by AXsetup.R script. 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
rm(list=ls())

library('config')
config = config::get()

setup_source = file.path(config$code_files$ax_setup_data)
source(setup_source) #, local = knitr::knit_global())

# Looks for existing model file and if its found, then load it and we will now have our previous models in the environment
outputfile = file.path(config$path$Rdata, config$Rdata_files$models)

if(file.exists(outputfile)){
  load(outputfile)
}

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
