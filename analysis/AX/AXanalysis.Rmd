Data set up is taken care of by AXsetup.R script. 




```{r setup, include=FALSE}

# This chunk below does not work properly, run AXsetup.R
# After AXsetup.R is run, AXQualtrics object should include empty cells for excluded sessions and there should be csv output with total number of missed trials per participant. 

rm(list=ls())

library('config')
config = config::get()

setup_source = file.path(config$code_files$ax_setup_data)
source(setup_source) #, local = knitr::knit_global()) # this command hung -- could be because AXsetup.R takes a long time? 


###### THIS IS CURRENTLY RUNNING AN RDM MODEL FILE -- NEEDS MODIFICATION TO AX
# Looks for existing model file and if its found, then load it and we will now have our previous models in the environment
outputfile = file.path(config$path$Rdata, config$Rdata_files$models)
# this runs /Volumes/CAP/Rdata/model_output_rdm.Rdata which is not what I want 

if(file.exists(outputfile)){
  load(outputfile)
}

```
